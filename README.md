# Social Media Site Clone Project

### Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp!

* Multi-User Social Media Site
* Part of a course to build websites with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 3, Javascript, jQuery, Python 3 and Django 1.11
... however I built it with Django 2.0.3, Python 3.6, Bootstrap 4 and Flexbox to make it more challenging.

Based on Section 24 of Pierian Data's course by Jose Portilla
